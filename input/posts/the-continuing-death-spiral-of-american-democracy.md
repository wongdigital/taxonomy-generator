excerpt: "I was feeling emotionally off today and I wasn’t quite sure until I realized that the events of January 6, 2021 deeply affected me as a patriotic American. At the time, I thought it was the culmination—the last act of a power-hungry, extremist wing of our country. Donald Trump and his deliberate peddlers of lies and misinformation had incubated and unleashed this insurrectionist mob against the Capitol, against the United States. But I was wrong."

I was feeling emotionally off today and I wasn’t quite sure until I realized that the events of January 6, 2021 deeply affected me as a patriotic American. At the time, I thought it was the culmination—the last act of a power-hungry, extremist wing of our country. Donald Trump and his deliberate peddlers of lies and misinformation had incubated and unleashed this [insurrectionist mob against the Capitol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Capitol_attack), against the United States.

But I was wrong. It was not the last act. It did not end. In fact, it continued to fester. One year on, as much as [21 million Americans](https://theconversation.com/21-million-americans-say-biden-is-illegitimate-and-trump-should-be-restored-by-violence-survey-finds-168359) think that Joe Biden did not legitimately win the 2020 election, and that Trump should be restored via violent means. That’s more than the population of New York state (19.3M)!

I struggle to understand what caused this, much less what the solution might be. Yes, the obvious cause was the Big Lie that Trump actually won the 2020 election. With the Republican Party constantly attacking the legitimacy of a free and fair election for months, it worked its base up into a frothy frenzy. But what caused that? Power? Maybe, but why? Why are they so hell-bent on holding onto power as to destroy our democracy?

In an effort to make sense of it all, here’s what I’ve been reading…

[Jimmy Carter: I Fear for Our Democracy](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/opinion/jan-6-jimmy-carter.html):

> For American democracy to endure, we must demand that our leaders and candidates uphold the ideals of freedom and adhere to high standards of conduct.

[Statement by President Obama on the Anniversary of the Assault on the Capitol](https://barackobama.medium.com/?p=f5e6a83599c7):

> Although initially rejected by many Republicans, the claims that fanned the flames of violence on January 6th have since been embraced by a sizeable portion of voters and elected officials — many of whom know better.

[NPR: 6 in 10 Americans say U.S. democracy is in crisis as the ‘Big Lie’ takes root](https://www.npr.org/2022/01/03/1069764164/american-democracy-poll-jan-6):

> A new [NPR/Ipsos](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/seven-ten-americans-say-country-crisis-risk-failing) poll finds that 64% of Americans believe U.S. democracy is “in crisis and at risk of failing.” That sentiment is felt most acutely by Republicans: Two-thirds of GOP respondents agree with the [verifiably false](https://apnews.com/article/voter-fraud-election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-7fcb6f134e528fee8237c7601db3328f) claim that “voter fraud helped Joe Biden win the 2020 election” — a key pillar of the [“Big Lie”](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/23/1065277246/trump-big-lie-jan-6-election) that the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump.

[Vox: January 6 should’ve moderated the GOP. It did the opposite.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22815765/january-6-capitol-insurrection-conservatism-sam-adler-bell):

> This New Right no longer believes we’re in a neutral liberal contest between competing ideas and concepts of the good. They believe the progressive left have taken over every aspect of American society and wield an authoritarian power over what, in particular, white Christians are allowed to say and think in this country; therefore this kind of libertarian consensus — which has presided in American conservatism, especially since Reagan — which prescribes a kind of private traditionalism and a public-facing liberalism, is totally insufficient for this moment.

[The Atlantic: Trump’s Next Coup Has Already Begun](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/january-6-insurrection-trump-coup-2024-election/620843/):

> Donald trump came closer than anyone thought he could to toppling a free election a year ago. He is preparing in plain view to do it again, and his position is growing stronger. Republican acolytes have identified the weak points in our electoral apparatus and are methodically exploiting them. They have set loose and now are driven by the animus of tens of millions of aggrieved Trump supporters who are prone to conspiracy thinking, embrace violence, and reject democratic defeat. Those supporters, Robert Pape’s “committed insurrectionists,” are armed and single-minded and will know what to do the next time Trump calls upon them to act.
