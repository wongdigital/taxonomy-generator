On the left, the barrel of an assault rifle held by a gloved hand is pointed, symbolizing the grim reality of gun violence and its impact on children. The dark background heightens the emotional tension, underscoring the unsettling juxtaposition of innocence and the threat of violence in modern society."
excerpt: "We’ve reached the point where schools are selling bulletproof backpack panels to protect kids from mass shootings. This is the NRA’s endgame: guns everywhere, from classrooms to churches to bars, with no meaningful gun control. Meanwhile, gun ownership is declining, but 69% of us live in fear of gun violence, thanks to a vocal minority holding our politics hostage. Bulletproof gear shouldn’t be a back-to-school essential, yet here we are."

We’ve come to this. The K-12 [Florida Christian School in Miami is selling bulletproof panels](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/11/07/health/bulletproof-panels-backpacks-trnd/index.html) for children to insert into their backpacks. Teachers will show students how to install these ballistic shields. You know, because mass shootings and ’Merica.

We have come to this, when schools need to outfit their students with bulletproof gear just to keep their students safe. This is the endgame for the National Rifle Association of America (aka NRA). It is guns everywhere. Schools, churches, hospitals, courthouses, bars. Everywhere.

In a recent interview on Fresh Air, [journalist Mike Spies](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/05/555859571/nra-backed-gun-laws-have-found-success-in-state-legislatures-across-the-u-s) said:

> So what you’ve seen over the last decade is a proliferation of legislation that has been enacted that has allowed people to carry firearms in places that they’ve never been able to carry before. That includes bars, churches, college campuses, day care centers, government buildings. That’s ultimately at the core of their agenda, is to normalize gun carrying in as many places as possible until it just becomes as natural of a thing to see in society as any other accessory that people carry around.

While the NRA wants to normalize guns everywhere via [concealed carry laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concealed_carry_in_the_United_States)—and it’s working very well legistlatively at the state level—gun ownership is steadily falling.

![A line graph titled ‘Gun ownership is falling’ shows the percentage of U.S. households with guns from 1978 to 2016, based on CBS News/New York Times polls. The graph starts at 51% in January 1978, peaks at 53% in January 1994, and declines steadily to 36% in June 2016. Key years and percentages are marked along the timeline, illustrating a long-term decline in household gun ownership.](/images/gun-ownership-is-falling.webp)

![A pie chart titled 'Many adults who don't currently own a gun could see themselves owning one in the future' shows the percentage breakdown of U.S. adults regarding gun ownership. 30% currently own a gun, 69% do not currently own a gun. Among those who don't own a gun, 36% could see themselves owning a gun in the future, while 33% say they could never see owning a gun. The data is from a Pew Research Center survey conducted in March and April 2017.](/images/gun-ownership.webp)

For the 69% of us who don’t wish to arm themselves we must live in fear of gunfights breaking out wherever we are. Remember that 20 children were murdered at [Sandy Hook Elementary School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting) in 2012. At least 12 of the people wounded or killed last Sunday in Sunderland, TX were children.

Bulletproof backpacks are a good idea. They solve a problem that’s growing increasingly frequent. A problem that we’ve let a special interest organization create because of its hardline stance against any gun control legislation. A special interest group with only 5 million members (6% of all gun owners, or 1.5% of the U.S. population) who have control of the Republican Party.

From Spies again:

> The NRA has become essentially an organ of the Republican Party. It doesn’t do anything for Democrats. It hasn’t for a long time. And the way it spends on election bears that out. It spends essentially all of its money, and quite a lot of money, trying to keep Republicans in power, putting new ones in power.

And how powerful is the NRA? Since 1998 it has spent [$203.2 million on political activities](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/oct/11/counting-up-how-much-nra-spends/). That includes direct contributions to candidates, contributions to political parties and PACs, lobbying, and outside spending. What’s outside spending? “Efforts expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.” Oh by the way, the [NRA spent $30 million on Donald Trump](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2016/11/the-nra-placed-big-bets-on-the-2016-election-and-won-almost-all-of-them/) last year.

In addition to money, the NRA can decide who wins and who loses. Here’s Spies talking about how a vindictive NRA lobbyist in Florida dealt with a lawmaker who let one of their sponsored bills die in committee:

> After that happened, he was also — or as it happened, he was also in his final term as a lawmaker, and he was hoping to be appointed to, like, a circuit court in Jacksonville and was among the, you know, final three potential candidates for that position. And it seemed like he was actually the favored candidate for Governor Scott, and Marion Hammer, remembering what he did, put together a huge campaign in which many thousands of NRA members sent emails to Governor Scott telling him under no circumstances to appoint Charles McBurney to the circuit court judgeship. And very shortly after that happened, McBurney was not appointed to the circuit court judgeship. Someone else was. And it was directly — I mean, you could say directly because of what he did.

So there you have it. We’ve allowed an organization like the NRA make the United States of America a country where we need to send our children to school with bulletproof backpacks. Well fucking done.

P.S. For children in preschool, you can buy them [bulletproof nap mats](http://www.businessinsider.com/bulletproof-blanket-for-kids-during-school-shootings-2015-12).
