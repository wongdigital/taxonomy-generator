Appearing on [Joe Rogan's podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k1ehaE0bdU), this week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Apple “[hasn’t] really invented anything great in a while.”

> Steve Jobs invented the iPhone and now they’re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later.

Let's take a look at some hard metrics, shall we?

I did a search of the [USPTO site](https://www.uspto.gov/) for patents filed by Apple and Meta since 2007. In that time period, Apple filed for 44,699 patents. Meta, nee Facebook, filed for 4,839, or about 10% of Apple's inventions.

![These images show two side-by-side screenshots of the USPTO Patent Public Search interface (version 3.0.22). The left image shows a search query for "apple inc" patents filed since 2007, which returned 44,699 results. The right image shows a search query for "facebook technologies" OR "meta platforms technologies" patents filed since 2007, which returned 4,839 results. Both interfaces display patent search results in a table format showing document IDs and publication dates from January 2025, with various search options and filters visible in the interface, including database selections (US-PGPUB, USPAT, USOCR) and search preferences like plurals and British equivalents.](/images/apple-and-meta-patents.png)

You can argue that not all companies file for patents for everything, or that Zuck said Apple hasn't "really invented anything _great_ in a while.” Great being the keyword here.

He left out the following "great" Apple inventions since 2007:
- App Store (2008)
- iPad (2010)
- Apple Pay (2014)
- Swift (2014)
- Apple Watch (2015)
- AirPods (2016)
- Face ID (2017)
- Neural engine SoC (2017)
- SwiftUI (2019)
- Apple silicon (2020)
- Vision Pro (2023) [arguable, since it wasn't a commercial success, but definitely a [technical feat](/posts/thoughts-on-apple-vision-pro)]

The App Store, I'd argue, is on the same level as the iPhone because it opened up an entire new economy for developers, resulting in an astounding [$935 billion market in 2025](https://vocal.media/01/mobile-app-usage-and-growth-statistics-for-2025-and-beyond). Apple Watch might be a close second, kicking off a [$38 billion market](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/smartwatch-market-106625) for smartwatches.

Let's think about Meta's since 2007, excluding acquisitions*:
- Facebook Messenger (2011)
- React (2013)
- React Native (2015)
- GraphQL (2015)
- PyTorch (2016)
- Ray-Ban Stories (2021)
- Llama (2023)

*Yes, excluding acquisitions, as Zuckerberg is talking about **inventions**. That's why WhatsApp, Instagram, and Quest are not included. Anything I'm missing on this list?

As you can see, other than Messenger and the Ray-Ban glasses, the rest of Meta's inventions are aimed at developers, not consumers. I'm being a little generous.

### Update 1/12/2025
I've added some products to the lists above based on some replies to my [Threads post](https://www.threads.net/@lunarboy/post/DEtOBtGSo2w?xmt=AQGzuouo7SohzZp72cjydKTXddnZNEdLgPqhrplCKslN7Q). I also added a sentence to clarify excluding acquisitions.
