"1000+" should be a familiar number for Google Reader users. My RSS feeds have been neglected in past months. Emails from AdAge.com, Creativity-Online, and links from friends go unread and unclicked. I've just been running 100 miles per hour at work. This is not to slam my [current employer](http://www.agencypja.com/ "PJA Advertising and Marketing") (because I truly like working here), but more of an observation.

If we creatives are always so busy with projects, and never take the time to look up, take off our headphones and find inspiration, our work _will_ suffer. Our work _will_ stagnate. Our work _will_ suck.

So this is a reminder to myself (and to other creatives) to take a bit of time each day to remain inspired. Surf the web. Watch TV. See a movie in a theater. Listen to new music. Read a magazine or a book. Go to a bookstore. Go to a museum. Go hiking.

[Eric Baker](http://designobserver.com/author.html?author=37 "Design Observer") spends 30 minutes every day scouring the web for inspirational images. He [shares them regularly](http://observatory.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=13138 "Today, 03.20.10: Observatory: Design Observer") on Design Observer.

And I've started to try to gather images and links that delight me in a couple of Tumblr blogs ([ELT](http://lunarboy.tumblr.com/ "ELT") and [\_\_\_ is awesome.](http://isawesome.tumblr.com/ "___ Is Awesome."))

This is also a reminder to managers of creatives: you must let them play. You have to structure your organization and processes to allow creative folks time to recharge and get inspired. [Google's 20% time](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/jobs/21pre.html "The Google Way: Give Engineers Room - New York Times") is a great example of how structuring some R&D/inspiration time can yield results. The Scotch Tape and Post-it Notes were invented by engineers at 3M during their [15% time](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/1998/01/9858 "The 15 Percent Solution"). Or taken to the extreme, [Stefan Sagmeister](http://www.sagmeister.com/index.html "---- Sagmeister, Inc. ----") closes his studio every seven years for a [yearlong sabbatical](http://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_the_power_of_time_off.html "Stefan Sagmeister: The power of time off | Video on TED.com") to get inspired again.

Now how can I get someone to pay me for a sabbatical?
