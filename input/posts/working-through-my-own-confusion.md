excerpt: "As someone who's always enjoyed writing across various platforms, I've finally decided to create a single home for all my thoughts and musings. Here's why I'm consolidating my content and what you can expect to find here."

I have always liked writing. I don’t fancy myself a professional writer in any way. Still, I like having an outlet (or outlets) for my random musings as I work through understanding the world, be it design, technology, or whatever. While I have published various blogs in the past or written articles and essays on Medium, I want my content hosted on a platform I own and control. So, I’m consolidating everything here on my personal site, which may become a haphazard amalgam of subjects.

This is officially the first post on this site, but I will be bringing in posts from the various past platforms and backdating them to their original publication dates.

I will also use this site to post links to stories and articles I’m reading. It will inevitably be an assortment of [design](/posts?category=Design), [tech](/posts?category=Technology), [Apple](/posts?category=Apple), and [politics](/posts?category=Politics).

To borrow from one of my favorite authors, [Jack Kerouac](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/2798-i-like-too-many-things-and-get-all-confused-and): I have nothing to offer except working through my own confusion.

Thank you for the indulgence.
