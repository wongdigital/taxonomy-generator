excerpt: "In the wake of Twitter finally fact-checking Trump's tweets and growing protests over George Floyd's murder, tech companies are being forced to confront their role in enabling harmful content. As designers, we're not just passive observers in this system - we help shape the digital world that billions of people interact with every day."

It is no secret that Twitter has enabled and emboldened Donald Trump by not restricting any of his tweets, even if they violated their terms of service. But earlier this week, they put [misinformation warnings](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/technology/twitter-trump-mail-in-ballots.html) on two of his tweets about mail-in ballots. This angered the President but also got the ball rolling. Snapchat shortly followed by saying it will [no longer promote Trump’s account](https://www.axios.com/snapchat-discover-trump-account-bbdfa6b8-f0cb-4c01-9a9d-c3dcb9b3de4e.html). Against the backdrop of growing protests against the murder of George Floyd by police, some tech companies finally started to grow a conscience. [But will Silicon Valley change?](https://www.wired.com/story/tech-companies-denounce-racism-will-silicon-valley-change/) Mary-Hunter McDonnell, corporate activism researcher from the Wharton School of Business says, “Giving money to organizations that are out on the front lines is more helpful, but it’s also to some extent passing the buck. People are tired of that.”

As designers, we have some power over the projects we work on, and the products we create. [Mike Monterio wrote in February](https://modus.medium.com/dear-designer-how-to-explain-to-your-kids-that-you-work-at-facebook-64a93bef7ac3), “At some point, you will have to explain to your children that you work, or once worked, at Facebook.”

While at Facebook, [Lisa Sy designed ways to flag hate speech](https://www.fastcompany.com/90511080/facebook-had-a-design-to-flag-trumps-hate-speech-in-2016) on the platform—using [Trump’s account in the mockups](https://twitter.com/lisasy/status/1266556800444166149). In 2016. Four years later, Facebook has not implemented such a system and continues to leave up dangerous posts from Trump, including the highly-charged “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” post.

Many of us will work on pieces that are seen by hundreds, maybe thousands. A few of us, having larger clients, or working at a tech company, might work on something used by millions, if not billions of people. We hold great responsibility.

We produce work for audiences, users. Humans who are on the other end of that screen, poster, or ad. Mike Monterio again:

> You don’t work for the people who sign your checks. [You work for the people who use the products of your labor.](https://modus.medium.com/dear-designer-hope-is-not-enough-70509b196a46) If I were to put my hope in one thing, it’s that you understand the importance of this. Your job is to look out for the people your work is affecting. That is a responsibility we cannot defer.
