The <em>New York Times</em> published a [story today about the Genius Bars](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/27/technology/circuits/27appl.html) in the Apple Stores, and how they are the &ldquo;souls of the stores.&rdquo; Mentioned within the article is the video loop that plays behind the Bar, which I had the pleasure and privilege of designing!
