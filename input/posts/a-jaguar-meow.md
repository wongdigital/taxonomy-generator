The central figure is dressed in an elaborate orange-red gown, surrounded by models in bold outfits of pink, red, yellow, and orange tones. The background transitions between shades of orange and pink, with the word ‘JAGUAR’ displayed prominently in the center."
excerpt: "Jaguar’s rebrand is bold but polarizing, trading heritage for hype. In the race for EV dominance, a flashy logo and film won’t cut it—it’s the product that defines the brand. Let’s break down what this redesign gets right, and what it misses."

The British automaker [Jaguar unveiled its rebrand](https://media.jaguar.com/news/2024/11/fearless-exuberant-compelling-jaguar-reimagined-0) last week, its [first step at relaunching the brand](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a62939000/jaguar-new-logos-brand-relaunch/) as an all-EV carmaker. [Much ink has been spilled](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jaguar-exec-promises-team-not-135758168.html) about the effort already, primarily negative, regarding the toy-like logotype in design circles and the bizarre film in the general town square.

Interestingly, [Brand New](https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew), the preeminent brand design website, hasn’t weighed in yet. It has decided to wait until after December 2, when Jaguar will unveil the first “physical manifestation of its Exuberant Modernism creative philosophy, in a Design Vision Concept” at Miami Art Week. _(Update: Brand New has weighed in with a [review of the rebrand](https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_campaign_for_jaguar_done_in_house.php). My commentary on it is [below](#update-2).)_

There have been some contrarian views, too, decrying the outrage by brand experts. In Print Magazine, [Saul Colt writes](https://www.printmag.com/industry-perspectives/you-are-all-wrong-about-the-jaguar-rebrand/):

> Critics might say this is the death of the brand, but I see it differently. It’s the rebirth of a brand willing to take a stand, turn heads, and claw its way back into the conversation. And that, my friends, is exactly what Jaguar needed to do.

With all due respect to Mr. Colt—and he does make some excellent points in his piece—I’m not in the camp that believes all press is good press. If Jaguar wanted to call attention to itself and make a _statement_ about its new direction, it didn’t need to abandon its nearly 90 years of heritage to do so. A brand is a company’s story over time. Jeff Bezos once said, “Your brand is what people say about you when you're not in the room.” I’m not so sure this rebrand is leaving the right impression. 

Here’s the truth: the [average tenure of a chief marketing officer](https://www.marketingweek.com/cmo-tenure-falls/) tends to be a short four years, so they feel as if they need to prove their worth by paying for a brand redesign, including a splashy new website and ad campaign filled with celebrities. But branding alone does not turn around a brand—a better product does. Paul Rand, one of the masters of logo design and branding, [once said](https://www.paulrand.design/writing/articles/1991-logos-flags-and-escutcheons.html):

> A logo derives its meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolizes, not the other way around.
> A logo is less important than the product it signifies; what it means is more important than what it looks like.

It’s the thing the logo represents and the meaning instilled in it by others. In other words, it’s not the impression you make but the impression you’re given.

There were many complaints about the artsy, haute couture brand film to introduce their new “Copy Nothing” brand ethos. The [brand strategy](/posts/what-is-brand-strategy) itself is fine, but the execution is terrible. As my friend and notable brand designer [Joe Stitlein says](https://www.threads.net/@stitz/post/DCnkEvGp6Zf?xmt=AQGz7NMyDaVCB9rQIri5VCFS26KoF_QJnZRgZP6nrJWblw), "At Nike, we used to call this 'exposing the brief to the end user.'" Elon Musk complained about the lack of cars in the spot, trolling with “Do you sell cars?” Brand campaigns that don’t show the product are fine as long as the spot reinforces what I already know about the brand, so it rings authentic. Apple’s famous “Think Different” ad never showed a computer. Sony’s new Playstation “Play Has No Limits” commercial shows no gameplay footage.

All major automakers have made the transition to electric. None have thrown away their brands to do so. Car marques like [Volkswagen](https://web.archive.org/web/20190917173231/https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-unveils-new-brand-design-and-logo-5337), [BMW](https://www.bmw.com/en/automotive-life/bmw-logo-meaning-history1.html), and [Cadillac](https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_cadillac_by_mother_design.php) have made subtle adjustments to their logos to signify an electrified future, but none have ditched their heritage.

Instead, they’ve debuted EVs like the Mustang Mach E, the Lyriq, and the Ioniq 5. They all position these vehicles as paths to the future.

Mr. Colt:
> The modern car market is crowded as hell. Luxury brands like Porsche and Tesla dominate mindshare, and electric upstarts are making _disruption_ their personal brand. Jaguar was stuck in a lane of lukewarm association: luxury-ish, performance-ish, but ultimately not commanding enough _ish_ to compete.

Hyundai built a splashy [campaign around the Ioniq 5](https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3494), but they didn’t do a rebrand. Instead, they built a cool-looking, retro-future EV that won [numerous awards](https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/footer/corporate/awards/ioniq5) when it launched, including [MotorTrend’s 2023 SUV of the Year](https://www.motortrend.com/news/hyundai-ioniq-5-2023-suv-of-the-year/).

We shall see what Jaguar unveils on December 2. The only teaser shot of the [new vehicle concept](https://insideevs.com/news/741742/jaguar-preview-new-ev-miami/) does look interesting. But the conversation has already started on the wrong foot.

## Update

_December 3, 2024_

As expected, Jaguar unveiled their new car yesterday. Actually, it’s not a new car, but a new concept car called Type 00. If you know anything about concept cars, they are never what actually ships. By the time you add the required safety equipment, including side mirrors and bumpers, the final car a consumer will be able to purchase will look drastically different.

Putting aside the aesthetics of the car, the [accompanying press release](https://media.jaguar.com/en-us/news/2024/12/jaguar-unveils-type-00-unmistakable-unexpected-dramatic) is full of pretension. Appropriate, I suppose, but feels very much like they’re pointing out how cool they are rather than letting the product speak for itself.

## <a id="update-2"></a>Update 2

_December 9, 2024_

Brand New has weighed in with a [review of the rebrand](https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_campaign_for_jaguar_done_in_house.php). Armin Vit ends up liking the work overall because it did what it set out to do—create conversation. However, his readers disagree. As of this writing, the votes are overwhelmingly negative while the comments are more mixed.
