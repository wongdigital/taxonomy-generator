excerpt: "I was sitting on a barstool next to my wife in a packed restaurant in Little Italy. We were the lone Kansas City Chiefs supporters in a nest full of hipster Philadelphia Eagles fans. After Jon Batiste finished his fantastic rendition of the national anthem, and the teams took the field for kickoff, I noticed something.

I was sitting on a barstool next to my wife in a packed restaurant in Little Italy. We were the lone Kansas City Chiefs supporters in a nest full of hipster Philadelphia Eagles fans. After Jon Batiste finished his [fantastic rendition of the national anthem](https://youtu.be/Gid1pYSOCZs?si=bGWO7PJIedyV_d_y), and the teams took the field for kickoff, I noticed something. The scorebug—the broadcast industry’s term for the lower-third or chyron graphic at the bottom of the screen—was different, and in a good way.

![Bluesky post from the author. It includes a photo of a TV showing the Super Bowl LIX game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. The scorebug is visible at the bottom of the screen. The score is 0-0, and the time is 8:03.](/images/the-new-fox-sports-scorebug-bluesky.jpg)

I [posted about it](https://bsky.app/profile/lunarboy.com/post/3lhrtn5dzjc2w) seven minutes into the first quarter, saying I appreciated “the minimalistic lower-thirds for this Super Bowl broadcast.” It was indeed refreshing, a break from the over-the-top 3D-animated sparkling. I thought the graphics were clear and utilitarian while being exquisitely-designed. They weren’t distracting from the action. As with any good interface design, this new scorebug kept the focus on the players and the game, not itself. I also thought they were a long-delayed response to Apple’s Friday Night Baseball scorebug.

Anyhow, as a man of good taste, John Gruber [also noticed](https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/DF30_x_vyIl) the excellence of the new graphics. Some of his followers, however, did not.

> It looks as if they just let an intern knock something up in PowerPoint and didn’t bother having someone check it first. Awful. 👎

> The scorebug is absolutely horrible! I really hope they don’t adopt this for the 2025 season, or I will riot. Horrible design and very distracting especially the score, this looks like something out of Fortnite.

Gruber has a wonderful and in-depth write-up about [FOX Sports’ new NFL scorebug](https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/fox_new_scorebug_graphic_design). Not only does it include a good design critique, but also a history lesson about the scorebug, which surprisingly, didn’t debut until 1994.

> Until 1994, the networks would show the score and time remaining when they cut to a commercial break, and then show it again when they came back from commercials.

I had totally forgotten about that.
