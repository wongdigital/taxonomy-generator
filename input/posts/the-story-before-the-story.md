His point is that a recent trend in “prestige TV” main titles is to use particle effects. Particle effects—if you don’t know—are simulations in 3D software that produce, well, particles that can be affected by gravity, wind, and each other—essentially physics. Particles can be styled to look like snow, rain, smoke, fireworks, flower petals, water (yes, water is just particles; see this [excellent video from Corridor Digital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdvNNm1kNu4)), or even Mordor’s orc hoards. This functionality has been in [After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) for decades in 2D but has been making its way into 3D packages like [Cinema 4D](https://www.maxon.net/en/cinema-4d) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). There’s a very popular program now called [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/), which does particle systems and other simulations really well. My theory is that because particle effects are simpler to produce and workstations with GPUs are cheaper and easier to come by, these effects are simply more within reach. They certainly _look_ expensive. 

Anyhow, I love it when mainstream media covers design. It brings a necessary visibility to our profession, especially in the age of generative AI. The [article is worth checking out (gift article)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/arts/television/tv-title-sequences.html?unlocked_article_code=1.p04.EM8b.HNJUOQvepcfj&smid=url-share) because Poniewozik embeds a bunch of videos within it.

This is also an excuse to plug one of my favorite TV main title sequences of all time, _True Blood_ by Digital Kitchen. It’s visceral, hypnotic, and utterly unstoppable. I watched it every time.

In an [interview with _Watch the Titles!_](https://www.watchthetitles.com/titlesequence/true-blood/) in 2009, Rama Allen, lead designer and concept co-creator of the sequence:
> After dipping ourselves in Southern Gothic, from Powers Boothe in Southern Comfort to digesting a pile of Harry Crews novels, one of the biggest ideas we latched onto was “the whore in the house of prayer.” This delicate balance of the sacred and profane co-existing creates powerful imagery. Editorially, we collided the seething behind-the-curtains sexuality of the South into the fist-pounding spirituality of Pentecostal healings to viscerally expose the conflicts we saw in the narrative of the show. Holy rollers flirt with perversion while godless creatures seek redemption.

Another all-time favorite of mine is, of course, _Mad Men_ by Imaginary Forces. Looking at this sequence again after having finished the series, it’s impressive how well it captures Don Draper’s story in just over 30 seconds.

In an [interview with _Art of the Title_ in 2011](https://www.artofthetitle.com/title/mad-men/), creative directors Steve Fuller and Mark Gardner point out the duality of the 1950s and ’60 eras’ characters—projecting respectability while giving in to their vices. This contrast became a key influence on the sequence’s design, reflecting the tension between their polished exteriors and hidden complexities.

Steve Fuller:
> Yeah, one thing that Matthew [Weiner] said kept echoing in my head. He said, “This is an era of guys wanting to be the head of the PTA but also drink, smoke, and get laid as much as possible.” That was the kind of dual life these guys were leading and that’s what was interesting.

The best titles give the viewer a sense of the story and its world while being visually interesting and holding the audience for up to a minute while the name cards roll.
