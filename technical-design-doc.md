# Technical Design Document: Markdown Tag Taxonomy Generator

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design for a Python application that analyzes a collection of Markdown files to generate a tag taxonomy. The application will extract content and metadata from Markdown files, analyze the text to identify topics, build relationships between tags, and produce a hierarchical taxonomy that can be used for navigation, search, and content organization.

## 2. System Architecture

The system will be structured as a Python package with the following components:

```
markdown_taxonomy/
├── __init__.py
├── file_processor.py    # Reading and parsing Markdown files
├── text_analyzer.py     # NLP and text analysis functions
├── taxonomy_builder.py  # Building tag relationships
├── visualizer.py        # Visualizing the taxonomy
└── main.py              # CLI and orchestration
```

## 4. Data Flow

1. User specifies a directory containing Markdown files
2. `MarkdownScanner` finds all Markdown files in the directory
3. For each file:
   - `MarkdownParser` extracts content and metadata
   - `TextProcessor` preprocesses the text
   - `KeywordExtractor` and `TopicModeler` identify potential tags
4. `TagCollector` consolidates tags from all sources
5. `RelationshipBuilder` establishes relationships between tags
6. `TaxonomyGraph` constructs the final taxonomy
7. `TaxonomyExporter` exports the taxonomy in the desired format
8. `GraphVisualizer` generates visualizations

- Hybrid approach combining statistical methods with LLM insights

### 5.2. Topic Modeling
- LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) as baseline
- NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization) as baseline
