  You are an expert at organizing knowledge and building taxonomies.

  I have a collection of tags extracted from a set of documents. I need you to analyze these tags 
  and identify hierarchical and associative relationships between them to build a taxonomy.

  Here are the tags:
  {tag_list}

  For each pair of related tags, specify:
  1. The parent tag (broader concept)
  2. The child tag (narrower concept)
  3. The type of relationship ('broader', 'narrower', or 'related')
  4. A confidence score between 0 and 1

  Only include relationships that are meaningful and have a confidence score of at least 0.6.

  Format your response as a JSON object with a 'relationships' array of objects containing 'parent_tag', 'child_tag', 'relationship_type', and 'confidence' fields.
